# RFStock App

## Overview
The RFStock App is an innovative solution designed to optimize budget management and resource allocation within university campuses. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and RFID technology, the app provides accurate predictions of material requirements, helping to reduce waste and improve financial efficiency.

## Problem Statement
1. **Budget Mismanagement**: Students often lose out on potential benefits due to poor budget allocation.
2. **Lack of Foresight**: Inability to predict future expenses accurately.
3. **Excessive Waste**: Over-ordering of food and other materials leads to significant waste.
4. **Fixed Budgets**: Monthly budgets are fixed, leading to lost funds that could be redirected to other activities.
5. **Inefficient Billing**: Invoices are prepared based on registered student numbers, not actual attendance.
6. **Standardized Meals**: Meals are prepared without considering student absences or holidays.

## Solution
The RFStock App uses AI to predict the quantity of materials needed for the upcoming month based on the number of students calculated via the unified RFID card. This innovative approach allows for:
- **Expense Optimization**: Precise knowledge of required quantities enables optimal budget control.
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Accurate forecasting of material needs.
- **Multi-Platform Software**: A versatile application that works across various platforms.

## Key Features
1. **Automatic Quantity Determination**: The program automatically determines the required quantity of goods based on student numbers using AI, saving significant costs and increasing accuracy.
2. **Inventory Display**: A modern, organized table that displays current inventory with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities.
3. **Scalability**: The program is designed with organized and flexible code, allowing for future expansion and easy understanding and use.

## How It Works
1. **Data Input Interface**: Users input required data, including product details, month, and holidays.
2. **AI Processing**: The AI processes the data to predict the quantity of materials students will consume.
3. **Storage**: The data is saved, and the AI begins its work to forecast future needs.

## Technologies Used
- **.NET 8.0**: A flexible framework that allows the program to be exported to multiple platforms with minor adjustments.
- **C#**: A fast and efficient programming language that ensures the program runs smoothly on various devices.
- **TRANSFORMS Algorithm**: Utilized in modern AI systems like GPT-3 and BERT, known for its:
  - **Positional Encoding**
  - **Attention**
  - **Self-Attention**

## Value Proposition
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use and navigate.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes advanced AI algorithms for precise predictions.
- **Improved Service Quality**: Optimal use of unified card data enhances service quality.

## Accuracy
After training, the program achieved an accuracy rate of **97.2%**, confirming its reliability and the strength of the algorithms used.
